ruuveal
=======

ruuveal decrypts encrypted zip files contained in RUUs released by HTC.

ruuveal has been (somewhat) tested but that doesn't mean it won't cause the end of the world as we know it. You have been warned. 

You will need to extract the zip file from the RUU executable before you can use this tool - use Google, there are a few methods.

One such method is unruu, available from:-

Compilation
-----------

ruuveal requires the development files for mcrypt. On Debian/Ubuntu based systems you can probably get these by installing the libmcrypt-dev package. On Redhat based systems the package to install is probably libmcrypt-devel. 

Once you have these files you can compile the development tree as follows:-

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make

Please note that once release tarballs area made the autogen.sh step will not be required since release tarballs ship with the configure script and the Makefile already generated.

Downloads
---------

Downloads are currently available from:-

* http://psi.kennynet.co.uk/ruuveal/

Usage
-----

    $ ruuveal [options] --device DEVICE source.zip output.zip

For example:

    $ ruuveal --device prototd rom.zip rom_new.zip

Once you have decrypted the zip file, it should unzip with any standard zip utility.
